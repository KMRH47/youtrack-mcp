# YouTrack MCP Integration Fixes

This document outlines the fixes made to the YouTrack MCP integration to address various issues with project and issue management.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Project Update Functionality

**Problem:** The `update_project` tool was not properly handling the `shortName` field, causing validation errors when trying to update projects.

**Fix:**
- Added support for the `short_name` parameter in the `update_project` method
- Properly mapped `short_name` to the YouTrack API's expected `shortName` field
- Enhanced error handling to better report and recover from API errors
- Added result verification to ensure updated fields are reflected in the response

### 2. Project Creation Stability

**Problem:** Project creation was sometimes returning incomplete project data or failing with validation errors.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced project creation to ensure all required fields are present
- Added additional validation to check for required parameters before API calls
- Improved error reporting for missing or incorrect parameters
- Added fallback mechanism to retrieve full project data after creation
- Implemented more robust JSON handling to prevent parsing errors

### 3. Issue Detail Retrieval

**Problem:** `get_project_issues` method wasn't returning complete issue information, missing crucial fields like summaries and descriptions.

**Fix:**
- Enhanced the API calls to request more comprehensive issue fields
- Modified the `get_project_issues` method to use a single efficient API call
- Improved field specification to include project, assignee, reporter, and custom field details
- Enhanced error handling to provide better feedback when issues can't be retrieved

### 4. Issue Creation and Project Lookup

**Problem:** Issue creation could fail when using project names instead of IDs, and error reporting was insufficient.

**Fix:**
- Improved project lookup by name when creating issues
- Better error handling when projects can't be found
- More detailed error reporting for API failures
- Added comprehensive validation before making API calls
- Enhanced post-creation retrieval to get complete issue details

## Testing the Fixes

A test script (`test_youtrack_fixes.py`) has been added to verify these fixes. The script:

1. Creates a test project with a specified short name
2. Updates the project to change the short name
3. Creates a test issue in the project
4. Adds a comment to the issue
5. Retrieves project issues to verify complete details

To run the test script:

```bash
python test_youtrack_fixes.py
```

## Remaining Known Issues

1. YouTrack API sometimes returns minimal responses after create/update operations, missing fields required by Pydantic models. We've implemented workarounds, but this may occasionally still cause validation warnings.

2. When the YouTrack API changes issue or project IDs unexpectedly, some operations might fail. The code now includes better error handling to report these situations clearly.

## Configuration

The YouTrack MCP integration requires proper configuration through environment variables:

```
YOUTRACK_URL=https://your-instance.youtrack.cloud
YOUTRACK_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
```

For YouTrack Cloud instances, you can set:

```
YOUTRACK_CLOUD=true
YOUTRACK_WORKSPACE=your-workspace-name
```
